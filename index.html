        <h1>About Me</h1>
        <h2>Hello I am Nurali</h2>
        <p>I am a Front End Developer currently working on projects that use the Angular Franework.
            I am a big fan of the RxJS library and love to spend time finding reactive solutions to incorporate in the
            apps I build.
            I was also a backend engineer for a while and so I am looking forward to expanding my skillset to be a
            <strong>Full Stack Engineer</strong> someday.
